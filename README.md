# NeuraFlow 🧠✨

**NeuraFlow** is a mobile application designed to support **cognitive and motor training** by strengthening inhibitory control, reaction timing, and executive functioning through short, adaptive, research‑grounded tasks.

This project is currently in **Phase 1 (Work in Progress)** and is being developed with scalability, maintainability, and production readiness in mind.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern digital environments contribute to cognitive overload through constant interruptions and context switching. NeuraFlow aims to counter this by providing a focused training environment where users can engage in intentional, repeatable cognitive exercises and track progress over time.

The application is structured to follow **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** best practices and supports iterative feature development.

## ✅ Current Features

- Onboarding / welcome flow
- Tab-based navigation using Expo Router
- Training screen placeholder
- Progress dashboard placeholder
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Scalable and modular project structure

---

## 📱 Tech Stack

The application uses the following technologies:

- **React Native** – Cross‑platform mobile development  
- **Expo** – Development tooling and device testing (Expo Go)  
- **TypeScript** – Static typing for improved reliability  
- **Expo Router** – File‑based navigation structure
- **React Hooks & Context API**
- **Node.js** - planned backend integration)**
- **VS Code** – Recommended editor

This stack enables rapid prototyping on both iOS and Android devices.
